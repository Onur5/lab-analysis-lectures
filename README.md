# Lab | Analysis Lectures


### Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?

    My favorite one is the one with the colors. Really laughed hard during these slides.

- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?

    I think he delivered it perfectly. Analyzing data is a trend now, sadly people are interpreting it often wrongly and try to deduce
    some relations that just are wrong
    
- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?

    Yes, it was quite funny and as I said before lays the finger on the right spot.
    
- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?

    To make sure that really everyone understands the joke, I would go a bit further and said that my next project will analyze how nobel
    winners look like and how you should dress if you want to increase your chances xD
